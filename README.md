# Hi there 👋

I’m **Sammy** (Abdisamad Omar), a developer passionate about **Web Development**, **AI**, and **Security**.  
I focus on building **scalable**, **minimalistic**, and **secure** applications that combine **clean design** with **efficient functionality** for real-world impact.  
Always curious, I enjoy experimenting and learning through hands-on projects.

## Fun Facts
🌿 I love nature and quiet environments  
🏋️‍♂️ I work out regularly, aiming for a shredded physique  
🧠 I study psychology, especially awareness and human behavior  
📌 I believe in building with purpose, not just for the sake of it
